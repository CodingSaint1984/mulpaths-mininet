Try to test the connectivity between all the hosts.
What would happen? How would you solve the problem? (40 points)Requirements:

a) Please provide a python code file named as “hw3.py” creating this topology.
b) Use the command “sudo python hw3.py”, and then put the screenshots of the process creating
this topology.
c) Use the command “pingall” after process b) in mininet to test the connectivity between all the
hosts. Put the output screenshots on the Ubuntu terminal in your report and talk about what
happened.
d) Try to use ovs-ofctl command to help solve the problem (Hint: ovs-ofctl can add flow rules
on your switches). A shell script named as “hw3.sh” is also required, which includes all the
ovs-ofctl commands you need to solve the problem
e) Open a new terminal and use the command “sh hw3.sh” and then repeat the process c) above
to test the connectivity between all the hosts again. Put the output screenshots on the Ubuntu
terminal in your report and talk about your thinking.
